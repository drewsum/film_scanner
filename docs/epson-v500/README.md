# Epson Perfection V500: native protocol notes

Working notes from reverse-engineering the V500 (`04b8:0130`, sold in Japan as the GT-X770).
Tracking issue: [#3](https://github.com/drewsum/film_scanner/issues/3).

## Why not ESC/I

Epson's SANE backend (`epkowa`) lists the V500 as needing a non-free "interpreter" plugin.
The plugin translates ESC/I into the scanner's own protocol and uploads firmware after
power-on. Bytes written to the bulk pipe show the scanner rejects most ESC/I commands:

| Sent | Reply | ESC/I meaning |
|------|-------|---------------|
| `1b 40` | `06` or `00` | `ESC @` initialise |
| `1b 49` | `15` (NAK) | `ESC I` identify |
| `1b 53` | `15` | `ESC S` |
| `1b 66` | `15` | `ESC f` extended status |
| `1b 46` | `15` | `ESC F` status |
| `1c 49` | `00` | `FS I` |
| `1b 03` | `81 00` / `18 81` | none |

Replies change from run to run, so a read may pick up bytes left over from earlier
commands. Don't treat these as semantics until captures confirm them.

## Epson's Windows driver (installed with Epson Scan)

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `C:\Windows\System32\esfw7c.bin` (65 793 bytes) | Firmware uploaded to the scanner |
| `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\esint7c.dll` | 32-bit interpreter (ESC/I to native) |
| `C:\Windows\System32\esxwia7c.dll` | WIA minidriver |
| `C:\Windows\twain_32\escndv\perv500.ds` | Epson Scan TWAIN data source (film, 48-bit, ICE) |

These are proprietary and must never be committed. A backend can load the firmware from
the user's installed driver, the same way SANE does.

Windows binds the scanner to `usbscan.sys`, which exposes the device as `\\.\Usbscan0`.
`ReadFile`/`WriteFile` on that file use the bulk IN/OUT pipes, so we can talk to the scanner
while Epson's driver stays installed. `IOCTL_SET_TIMEOUT` is `0x8000202C`.

## Tools

```sh
# List usbscan devices, then send raw transfers and print the replies
cargo run -p scan-epson --bin epson-probe -- --list
cargo run -p scan-epson --bin epson-probe -- 1b40

# Capture with USBPcap (admin shell). Find the root hub the scanner is on with
# `USBPcapCMD.exe` (interactive), then:
"C:\Program Files\USBPcap\USBPcapCMD.exe" -d \\.\USBPcap1 -o capture.pcap -A

# Print the conversation and dump the raw image stream
cargo run -p scan-epson --bin epson-trace -- capture.pcap --dump-data scan.bin
```

Captures hold only scanner traffic, but don't commit large ones. Keep the decoded logs.
